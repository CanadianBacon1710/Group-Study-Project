Game Directory Website

Our website is called the Game Directory. It's purpose is for people to see the best games of the week. Each section will contain images of the newest or hottest games or devices, you will be able to read information or reviews about the product beforehand to see if it gains your interest. When an image is clicked it will take you to the homepage of that game or product, allowing you to explore and learn more about it. Our website will have three main parts; The Home Page, The Game Directory and The Reviews, we will have links to each game developers page as well as credit to all the reviewers, lastly our website will have a light and dark mode.
